## 🚀 Tech Stack

### Frontend

* **React.js**
* Axios for API communication
* Role-based routing (Admin / User dashboards)

### Backend

* **Django**
* **Django REST Framework**
* **JWT Authentication (SimpleJWT)**
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

### Database

* **PostgreSQL**

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

* JWT-based authentication
* Access & Refresh tokens
* Role-based access:

  * **Admin** → Full access
  * **User** → Own resources only

---

## 📌 Backend Documentation

📁 A **detailed backend README** is available inside the `backend/` folder, which includes:

* API endpoints
* Authentication flow
* CRUD operations
* RBAC implementation
* Setup & scalability notes

> This separation is intentional and follows backend-focused assignment requirements.

---

## 🖥️ Frontend Overview

* Basic React UI for authentication and dashboards
* Integrates with backend APIs using JWT
* Separate dashboards for Admin and User roles
* Designed to be minimal and functional, as the assignment focus is backend logic

---

## 🗄️ Database

* PostgreSQL is used as the primary database
* Managed via Django ORM and migrations

---

## ✅ Assignment Scope Coverage

✔ Full-stack implementation
✔ Secure authentication & authorization
✔ CRUD functionality
✔ PostgreSQL integration
✔ Frontend–backend API integration
✔ Clean project structure
